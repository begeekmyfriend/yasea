 * aligned to 32 bytes.
 * gcc 4.2 introduced __attribute__((force_align_arg_pointer)) to fix this
 * problem, but I don't want to require such a new version.
 * aligning to 32 bytes only works if the compiler supports keeping that
 * alignment between functions (osdep.h handles manual alignment of arrays
